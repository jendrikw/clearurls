Bringing the power of the [ClearURLs](https://clearurls.xyz/) rules to Rust.
Easily remove tracking parameters and other nuisance from URLs with a simple API:

```rust
use clearurls::UrlCleaner;
fn main() -> Result<(), clearurls::Error> {
    let cleaner = UrlCleaner::from_embedded_rules()?;
    let res = cleaner.clear_single_url("https://example.com/test?utm_source=abc")?;
    assert_eq!(res, "https://example.com/test");
    Ok(())
}
```


## Crate Features

There is a `std` feature (enabled by default) to include utility functions to read from files,
but the core logic doesn't depend on that and the crate is perfectly usable without `std`.
